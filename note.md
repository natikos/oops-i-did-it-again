# Developer Review Notes

Please read this:

- **Tests need to be added**: The current implementation lacks automated tests. Adding unit and integration tests will improve reliability and maintainability.
- **Developer filtering**: Implement filtering functionality for developers to allow more flexible queries and results. Only API is implemented.
- **Parameter validation**: Add validation for input parameters to ensure data integrity and prevent errors.
